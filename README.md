Components Setup:
Create three components: Form, ColorList, and SingleColor.
In the App component, render the Form and ColorList components.

Form Component:
Set up a color state and a form with an input field. Implement handleChange to update the color state. Implement handleSubmit to add the color to the list.

Color Generation:
Install the values.js library.
Use it in the App component to generate a list of colors. Pass the colors list to the ColorList component.

ColorList Component:
Iterate over the list of colors and render each in a SingleColor component.Ensure unique keys for each color.

SingleColor Component:
Display hex value and weight (percent).
Use inline CSS to set the background color.
Implement a click handler to save the hex value to the clipboard.

React-toastify Integration:
Import and set up the react-toastify library.In the App component, create logic to generate a new color list.Use react-toastify to display error messages for color generation issues and empty submissions.

This flow provides a structured approach to building a color-related application with various functionalities and error handling using React and associated libraries.
